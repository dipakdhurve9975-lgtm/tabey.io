    <p>Last Updated: FEBRUARY 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>TABEY</strong>. By accessing or using our mobile application and website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must discontinue use of our services immediately.</p>

    <h2>1. General Service Description</h2>
    <p>TABEY operates as a technology platform connecting users ("Customers") with third-party independent food outlets ("Vendors") and independent delivery partners ("Riders"). TABEY is not a restaurant or food preparation entity. We facilitate the ordering and delivery process but do not take responsibility for the food preparation itself.</p>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the platform.</li>
      <li>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process (Name, Mobile Number, Address).</li>
      <li>You are responsible for safeguarding your password and account details. Any activity under your account is your responsibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Orders & Acceptance</h2>
    <p>Placement of an order does not guarantee acceptance. The Vendor has the right to accept or reject an order based on availability, capacity, or other factors. Once an order is confirmed, a contract is formed between you and the Vendor.</p>

    <h2>4. Pricing & Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All prices listed on the app are determined by the Vendors.</li>
      <li>TABEY may charge a <strong>Delivery Fee</strong>, <strong>Service Fee</strong>, or <strong>Surge Fee</strong> during peak hours or bad weather conditions.</li>
      <li>We accept Cash on Delivery (COD) and digital payments (UPI). You agree to pay the total amount shown at checkout.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cancellation & Refunds</h2>
    <p>As food is a perishable good, we have a strict cancellation policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer Cancellation:</strong> You can only cancel an order within 1 minute of placing it. Once the restaurant starts preparation, cancellations are not permitted and no refund will be issued.</li>
      <li><strong>Defective Items:</strong> If food is missing, spilled, or spoiled, please contact Customer Support with photo proof within 15 minutes of delivery for a resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Delivery Policy</h2>
    <p>Delivery times quoted are estimates and vary based on traffic, weather, and restaurant preparation time. TABEY riders will attempt delivery to the address provided. If the customer is unreachable after multiple attempts, the order may be cancelled without a refund.</p>

    <h2>7. Food Quality & Liability</h2>
    <p>The Vendor is solely responsible for the quality, safety, taste, and hygiene of the food. TABEY disclaims all liability regarding food poisoning, allergies, or foreign objects in food. Customers with severe allergies should contact the restaurant directly before ordering.</p>

    <h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the platform for any unlawful purpose. Harassment, abuse, or threatening behavior towards our delivery partners or support staff will result in an immediate and permanent ban from the platform.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For any legal concerns or clarifications regarding these terms, please contact us via the Support section in the app or email us at <strong>helptabey@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
